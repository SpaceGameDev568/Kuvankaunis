Kuvankaunis is the Finnish word for "Picturesque", and it describes perfectly what you'll find in this Minecraft Modpack! We've got more then just pretty graphics though, here's an overview of the features:

## Features:

### Accessibility

You'll find that the UI is in dark mode for improved readibility and to be easy on the eyes for late-night Minecraft Sessions. We've also included Controller/Gamepad support thanks to MidnightControls, so you can use whatever input device best suits your preferences!

The vanilla F3 menu is a disaster and incredibly difficult to read, so we've incorporated BetterF3 to clean things up and provide a friendly and customizable menu.

### Graphics

Iris is included, and Solas Shader is enabled by default for the best look.
The UI now has beautiful blurred background, and the menus have transparent buttons to allow you to still be immersed in the world. Speaking of the world...

### World

All three dimensions have been completely overhauled. Terralith revamps the original biomes into something new and fresh, while Biomes O' Plenty adds tons of unique new biomes never seen before to the Overworld and the Nether. The Nether and End also get a fresh coat of paint, with Incendium and Nullscape changing how you roam these alien landscapes completely.

There are seasons now, with Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter all bringing their own challenges.
They change how the weather works, the colors of foliage, and how your crops will grow.

### Optimization

You can't have a modern Minecraft Modpack without some major optimization to keep those frames smooth! Sodium and Lithium are already subsumed, bringing with them improved rendering and logic handling, as well as a more user-friendly options menu.

The game will also dynamically adjust your FPS to allow your computer to save electricity when you are idle.
